# GUI-Application-To-Get-DIstance-Between-2-Places-In-Python
In this I've built a GUI Application using Python which gets the distance between 2 places. This is done using the geopy module in Python. The GUI here is built using the
Tkinter module. geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services. 
geopy includes geocoder classes for the OpenStreetMap Nominatim, Google Geocoding API (V3), and many other geocoding services.
